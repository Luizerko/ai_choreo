# AI-Generated Choreography - from Solos to Duets

This repository is dedicated to the development of the project [AI-Generated Choreography - from Solos to Duets](https://humanai.foundation/gsoc/2024/proposal_ChoreoAI1.html). Here, you will find all the documentation and code for implementing my pipeline.

Special thanks to my supervisors, [Mariel Pettee](https://marielpettee.com/) and [Ilya Vidrin](https://www.ilyavidrin.com/), for all their guidance, and to my work partner, Zixuan Wang, for developing [her pipeline](https://github.com/wang-zixuan/AI-Choreo-Duets/tree/main) alongside mine.

## Repository Hierarchy

- The `evaluation_test` folder contains my application for the contributor position. In there, you can find a `README` with all the information regarding the implementations for the selection process test and also the results obtained. You can also find the notebook with the source code for everything I developed. Fortunately, I had the pleasure to expand this `README` and continue the project development.

- The `pose_extraction` folder contains details about the pose extraction pipeline used to create the project dataset. It includes an installation process guide, the raw data used, and information on the development and execution of the idea.

- The `model` folder contains the project's core, including installation instructions, pipeline design, and running guidelines for the duet choreography generation model. It also has detailed results for a thorough evaluation on the quality of the final agent.

- The root of the repository naturally provides an overview of the project, showcasing sample generations from the developed model.
