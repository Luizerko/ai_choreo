# AI-Generated Choreography - from Solos to Duets

This repository is dedicated to the development of the project [AI-Generated Choreography - from Solos to Duets](https://humanai.foundation/gsoc/2024/proposal_ChoreoAI1.html). Here, you will find all the documentation and code for implementing my pipeline.

Special thanks to my supervisors, [Mariel Pettee](https://marielpettee.com/) and [Ilya Vidrin](https://www.ilyavidrin.com/), for all their guidance, and to my work partner, Zixuan Wang, for developing [her pipeline](https://github.com/wang-zixuan/AI-Choreo-Duets/tree/main) alongside mine.

## Repository Hierarchy

- The `evaluation_test` folder contains my application for the contributor position. In there, you can find a `README` with all the information regarding the implementations for the selection process test and also the results obtained. You can also find the notebook with the source code for everything I developed. Fortunately, I had the pleasure to expand this `README` and continue the project development.
