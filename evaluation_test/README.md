# Evaluation Test Report

This is a `README` containing all the information regarding the development of the evaluation test.

## Loading Data

This is the pre-test part of the project, consisting of replicating [Mariel's code](https://github.com/mariel-pettee/choreo-graph/blob/main/functions/load_data.py) to properly load and preprocess the [provided data](https://github.com/mariel-pettee/choreo-graph/tree/main/data). In here you can find code to load data, put everything in a very handable data structure and format, preprocess the joint positions so that they belong to the same unit cube (since we are interested in relative motion instead of absolute motion), and finally compute the edges.
